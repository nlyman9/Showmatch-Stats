1v1 Showmatch Stats

Task: Gets stats from all of JohnnyBoi_i's YouTube 1v1 showmatch videos
These stats include players, wins, goals, players played against, points, saves, shots

Process:

- Get stats data from YouTube
- Build database for stats
- Build application and GUI and website for using the database

Step 1:

How to get stats from YouTube?

Can get these stats from the video title, and parsing end game stats screen of each game played

Best way to parse end game stats screen?

- Use python, opencv, and pytesseract to parse image data into text (MOSTLY DONE)

Step 2:

- Figure out a way to break down youtube videos into images.
Would be handy to do this on a specific part of the screen. One image that just selects the timer
which is parsed into a number. We want it to be 0 before we start taking screenshots and testing if the game has ended

- After we figured out that the game has ended, take a screenshot of the scoreboard
- Find a way to figure out if the series has ended. Add intermediate results together to see if it works.

Step 3:

- Create a structure that can house the data from the rocket league games, preferably a database.
- Decide what database we want to use and figure out how to implement it

Step 4:

- Wrap the database in a web application that people can use to look up stats about Johnny's 1v1 matches
- ???
- Profit

NOTES:

- have to find point in video when stats screen is then figure out a way to read the text in the image
- to find the point, can skip video until timer = 0, then take images of video every few seconds until the stats
screen is shown, and then reset for the next game
- Can shorten videos by using streamable.com
- Can get images from videos in a playlist using VCL
- Can add these shortened videos to a personal playlist in youtube?
- 9 seconds between game ending and stats screen shown
